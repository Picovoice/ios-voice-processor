The iOS Voice Processor is an asynchronous audio capture library designed for real-time audio
processing. Given some specifications, the library delivers frames of raw audio data to the user via
listeners.

## Requirements

- [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)

## Compatibility

- iOS 13.0+

## Installation

iOS Voice Processor is available via CocoaPods. To import it into your iOS project, add the following line to your Podfile:
```ruby
pod 'ios-voice-processor'
```

## Permissions

To enable recording with your iOS device's microphone you must add the following to your app's `Info.plist` file:
```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>[Permission explanation]</string>
```

See our [example app](./example) or [this guide](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avaudiosession/1616601-requestrecordpermission) for how to properly request this permission from your users.

## Usage

Access the singleton instance of `VoiceProcessor`:

```swift
import ios_voice_processor

let voiceProcessor = VoiceProcessor.instance
```

Add listeners for audio frames and errors:

```swift
let frameListener = VoiceProcessorFrameListener { frame in
    // use audio
}

let errorListener = VoiceProcessorErrorListener { error in
    // handle error
}

voiceProcessor.addFrameListener(frameListener);
voiceProcessor.addErrorListener(errorListener);
```

Start audio capture with the desired frame length and audio sample rate:

```swift
do {
    try voiceProcessor.start(frameLength: 512, sampleRate: 16000);
} catch {
    // handle start error
}
```

Stop audio capture:
```swift
do {
    try voiceProcessor.stop();
} catch {
}
```

Once audio capture has started successfully, any frame listeners assigned to the `VoiceProcessor`
will start receiving audio frames with the given `frameLength` and `sampleRate`.

### Capturing with Multiple Listeners

Any number of listeners can be added to and removed from the `VoiceProcessor` instance. However,
the instance can only record audio with a single audio configuration (`frameLength` and `sampleRate`),
which all listeners will receive once a call to `start()` has been made. To add multiple listeners:
```swift
let listener1 = VoiceProcessorFrameListener({_ in })
let listener2 = VoiceProcessorFrameListener({_ in })
let listeners: [VoiceProcessorFrameListener] = [listener1, listener2];

voiceProcessor.addFrameListeners(listeners);

voiceProcessor.removeFrameListeners(listeners);
// or
voiceProcessor.clearFrameListeners();
```

## Example

The [iOS Voice Processor app](./example) demonstrates how to ask for user permissions and capture output from the `VoiceProcessor`.
